# Project-JAVA-2022
Menus for admin, teacher and student.

The main class of this project is "ClaseDemo" where we run the code.
You can use the code as it is, but you have to do just a few changes for it to run properly on your computer.

This project has a class named "StaticDatabase" which contains static data about students, teachers and courses.
In "ManagerCursuri" we redirect this static data in some local XML files.

You have to change with the path of your own files at the following lines in "ManagerCursuri":
- line 275 at final String xmlFilePath;
- line 323 at final String xmlFilePath;
- line 362 at final String xmlFilePath;
- line 400 at final String FILENAME;
- line 432 at final String xmlFilePath;
- line 467 at final String FILENAME.

Once you've done this changes, your project should run correctly.
